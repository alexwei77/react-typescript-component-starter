# react-typescript-component-starter-kit

> A React component starter kit written in Typescript using the power of Babel 7 and Webpack 4.

#### There are already so many starter kits. Why this?

> Yes, I am already aware of those but setting up Babel 7 with storybook and typescript was not that straightforward ðŸ˜¥. This repo is mainly for that. Other things are just extras which I use personally.
